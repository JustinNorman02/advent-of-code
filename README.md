# My Advent of Code

This repo contains my solutions for the Advent of Code puzzles. [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com) is a yearly 25-day coding challenge in the style of an advent calendar created by [Eric Wastl](https://was.tl/). For more information about Advent of Code [click here](https://adventofcode.com/2024/about).

My solutions are in no way efficient or well implemented, but for the most part, they get the right answer.




## How to use

If you want to try my solutions (wouldn't recommend it) then once you clone the repo you will have to run CreateFolders.bat:

    1. Open cmd or powershell
    2. Change directory into the repo (i.e. 'cd C:\Users\Me\advent-of-code')
    3. Run the bat with the following syntax '.\CreateFolders.bat {year} {num_of_folders}' 
        (i.e. '.\CreateFolders.bat 2024 25)

The script will now create any missing folders and files. The main one you are interested in is the data.txt file which is where you put your problem data for each day.

This script can also be used to generate the folder structure for a new year using the same syntax.
